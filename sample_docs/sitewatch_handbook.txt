SITEWATCH OPERATIONS DECISION HANDBOOK
Building & Construction Safety Authority — Field Reference v4.1

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CHAPTER 1: WIND THRESHOLDS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1.1 Tower Crane Operations
  Green  (below 38 km/h):  Full operations permitted.
  Amber  (38–50 km/h):     Reduce loads to 60% SWL. Supervisor on site.
  Red    (50–65 km/h):     Suspend all lifts. Secure all suspended loads.
  Black  (above 65 km/h):  Evacuate all elevated positions immediately.
  NOTE: If gust exceeds sustained wind by >15 km/h, apply the next tier.

1.2 Scaffolding & Formwork
  Erection/Dismantling:    Suspend above 45 km/h.
  Occupied scaffolding:    Suspend above 55 km/h.
  Temporary formwork:      Inspect and re-brace above 60 km/h.

1.3 Rooftop & Facade Work
  General rooftop access:  Suspend above 40 km/h sustained.
  Glazing / cladding:      Suspend above 30 km/h (large panel sail effect).
  Facade abseiling:        Suspend above 25 km/h.

CHAPTER 2: TEMPERATURE THRESHOLDS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

2.1 Concrete Works
  Below 4°C:    Hot mix required. Insulating blankets post-pour. Extended cure 14 days.
  4°C – 10°C:   Standard mix. Monitor curing temperature every 2 hours.
  10°C – 32°C:  Standard conditions. 7-day minimum cure.
  32°C – 38°C:  Shade aggregate and water. Chilled water preferred. Night pours advised.
  Above 38°C:   Night pours mandatory. Chilled water in mix required.
  CRITICAL: Do not allow concrete to freeze within first 48 hours of pour.

2.2 Structural Steel
  Welding below -10°C:     Pre-heat steel to 50°C before welding.
  Painting/coating:        Suspend below 5°C or above 40°C. Relative humidity >85% also suspends.

2.3 Worker Heat Stress (Apparent Temperature)
  27–32°C:   10-minute shade break every 45 minutes. Hydration mandatory.
  32–39°C:   Buddy system. 15-minute break every 30 minutes. Supervisor monitoring.
  39–46°C:   Reduce physical intensity. 20-minute break every 20 minutes.
  Above 46°C: Suspend all outdoor work. Emergency cool areas only.

2.4 Cold Stress (Wind Chill Temperature)
  -10°C to -20°C:  15-minute warm break every 30 minutes.
  Below -20°C:     Suspend outdoor work. Emergency shelter protocol.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CHAPTER 3: RAIN & PRECIPITATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

3.1 Concrete Pouring
  Rain intensity:
    Below 2 mm/hr:   Proceed with tenting where possible.
    2–4 mm/hr:       Delay pour unless full-span tenting is in place.
    Above 4 mm/hr:   Suspend all open concrete works.

3.2 Excavation & Earthworks
  Rainfall >10 mm in past 24 hours: Assess slope stability before resuming.
  Active rainfall any intensity:     Suspend trenching within 2m of structures.
  Ponding on site:                   Suspend all excavation until drainage confirmed.

3.3 Electrical & Mechanical Works (Outdoor)
  Any active rain:   Suspend all outdoor electrical connection work.
  Post-rain:         30-minute dry period required before resuming outdoor electrical.

3.4 Demolition
  Wind + rain combined:  Lower wind thresholds by 15% for all demolition activities.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CHAPTER 4: LIGHTNING PROTOCOL
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Lightning within 15 km:   Alert all elevated workers. Cease crane operations.
Lightning within 8 km:    Evacuate all scaffold and elevated positions.
Lightning within 3 km:    Full site stand-down. All workers to internal shelter.
Resume criteria:          30-minute clear period after last lightning within 15 km.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CHAPTER 5: VISIBILITY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Vehicle movements:        Suspend site traffic if visibility below 50m.
Crane operations:         Rigger must have continuous visual contact with load.
Rooftop work:             Minimum 150m visibility. Fog/mist: postpone.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CHAPTER 6: MORNING BRIEFING REQUIREMENTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Every morning before 07:00, the Site Manager must confirm:
  □ 6-hour weather forecast reviewed.
  □ Any amber/red/black conditions documented in site log.
  □ All supervisors briefed on day's restrictions.
  □ Crane operator wind checks completed (ground + boom tip).
  □ Concrete pours scheduled only if temperature window is confirmed.

Weather risk rating:
  LOW:      All conditions green. Full operations.
  MEDIUM:   One amber condition. Heightened monitoring required.
  HIGH:     Red condition present OR two amber simultaneously.
  CRITICAL: Black condition OR lightning within 8 km.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CHAPTER 7: ESCALATION MATRIX
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Risk LOW or MEDIUM:   Site Manager authority. Log decision.
Risk HIGH:            Site Manager + Safety Officer sign-off required.
Risk CRITICAL:        Site Manager + Safety Officer + Client HSE Rep.
                      All work suspended pending joint assessment.

Any weather-related near-miss or injury: Report to Safety Officer within 15 minutes.
HSEMS entry required within 2 hours for any go/no-go decision at HIGH or above.
